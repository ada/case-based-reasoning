\section{Background and related work}
Robert Gubkar and Michal Kuba from the university of Zilinia in Slovakia
conducted a study about comparision of audio features for elementary sound
based audio classification. They compared two sets of audio features for classification
of various sonds such as applause, crying, laugh, music, noise and speech.
The first set of features consist of mel-frequency ceptral coefficients together with
their first and seconds order time derivaties. The seconds set consists of line
spectral frequencies, spectral flux and zero crossing rate. Their test shows that
the second set of features were superior to classical MFCC coefficients for general
sound patter recognition and comparable for speech recognition.
