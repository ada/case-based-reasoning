The pursuit of the perfect bird classifier is ongoing. Automated classifiers
can facilitate research such as ornithology and ecology, and prevent plane
crashes. In this paper we present how we used Case-based Reasoning to develop
an automated audio-based bird specie classifier. The case base was built out
of recordings from 8 different species. Frame division was used for higher
performance and we use periodogram as feature extraction method. Our project
resulted in a working application that can identify the specie of the bird
singing in the recording. Our goal was a high accuracy and a low footprint
which we achieved.
