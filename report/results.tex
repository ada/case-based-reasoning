\section{Results and discussion}
The development of the bird classifier using cased-based reasoning has
been successful in many ways. The final version met all the initial requirements
stated at the beginning of the project and the code has a low footprint while
providing an adequate performance.

The test has showed that it is possable to classify a noisy, different audio strength Bofink compared to a database with no noize and high quality audio sounded birds.

The tests shows that using euclidian and manhattan distance does not yield accurate results.
Multiple test with canberra distance with different weight configuration have the most accurate result.

List of possable high accuracy configuration.
This may not be the best configuration beacause it is done by trial and error, but it yields accurate results.
Config 1: Canberra, FFT Peak 1 Delta, FFT Area Delta.
Config 2: Canberra, FFT Peak 1.
Config 3: Canberra, FFT Peak 1, FFT Area Delta.
