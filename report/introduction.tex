\section{Introduction}
Bird song classification is not only useful for enthusiastic bird watchers.
It contributes to research fields such as ornithology and ecology[1], for
example conservatory planning [3] and the understanding of of how climate
change affects bird populations[1]. It is also useful for preventing plane
crashes caused by collisions with birds [3].

Singing serves different purposes for birds. For example identify individuals
and kinship, threaten rivals and choose partner [2]. Just like human speech,
bird song have a grammar and are built on syllables[3]. Some birds hide and
therefore sound is the only way for humans to know their precense.

Since automated bird classification can be more efficient and accurate than
manual, a lot of research has been done. One of the challenge is that the
recordings are nautrally noisy and can contain sound from many individuals
at the same time [2]. Extraction of useful features is crucial [3].
